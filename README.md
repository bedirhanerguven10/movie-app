[Reach out my live project !](https://master--pedro-movie-app.netlify.app/)

## In this project ; 

*I made an Movie App with React & Firebase(for Authentication).
*User can login with his/her Google account or register and create new user.
*If some error happens while logging in, some alerts will show up which I created using react-hot-toast.
*I used Bootstrap and pure css for styling.
*I get the data with AXIOS and fetch from themoviedb
*I added some restrictions. Without logging in user can not reach details page or can not make a search.
*I used useNavigate to redirect to desired pages.
